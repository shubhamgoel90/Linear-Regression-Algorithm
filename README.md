# Linear-Regression-Algorithm
In this repository we are building our Linear Regression Algorithm from scratch with the help of gradient descent.

In this for checking our algo, we have used the random variables and thier random values with the help of numpy library and then we have generated the random test points and then predicts it's outcome and we have also plotted the error graph.

### Libraries Used:-
1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib.pyplot
